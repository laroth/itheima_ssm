# itheima_ssm
This is a practise with ssmuse.I use two way to comlete this pratise.<br>
The first one is with annotation,and the second one is with xml<br>
The branch Master is a empty project with completed configuration of ssm and completed controller,service,and half-completed Mapper;<br>
The branch Anno is a finished project with annotation.<br>
The branch XML is a finished project with Mybatis XML.<br>
