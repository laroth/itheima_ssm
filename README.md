# itheima_ssm
This is a practise with ssmuse.I use two way to comlete this pratise.
The first one is with annotation,and the second one is with xml
The branch Master is a empty project with completed configuration of ssm and completed controller,service,and half-completed Mapper;
The branch Anno is a finished project with annotation.
The branch XML is a finished project with Mybatis XML.
